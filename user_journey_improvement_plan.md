# Website User Journey Improvement Plan

Based on the goal of showcasing a portfolio and generating freelance leads for web development/design and data analysis services targeting tech-savvy SMBs and startups.

**Analysis of Current Likely User Flow & Friction Points**

Given the structure (Home -> About / Services / Portfolio / Contact), potential users likely follow these paths:

1.  **Service-Curious Path:** `Home` -> `Services` (Learn what you offer) -> `Portfolio` (Look for proof) -> `Contact` (If convinced)
2.  **Portfolio-Driven Path:** `Home` -> `Portfolio` (See examples) -> `Services` (See if specific need is met) / `About` (Learn about expertise) -> `Contact` (If impressed)
3.  **About-First Path:** `Home` -> `About` (Learn who you are) -> `Services` / `Portfolio` -> `Contact`

**Potential Friction Points:**

*   **Service-Portfolio Disconnect:** Users viewing the `Services` page might not easily find *relevant* examples on the `Portfolio` page without significant manual searching or filtering.
*   **Weak CTAs:** After viewing Services or Portfolio items, the next step (Requesting a Quote/Contacting You) might not be immediately obvious or compelling.
*   **Generic Contact:** A standard `Contact` page might feel less targeted than a "Request a Quote" action.
*   **Information Silos:** Skills (`About`/`Services`) and proof (`Portfolio`) might feel too separated.

**A. Proposed User Journey Map (Optimized Flow)**

Goal: Create a smoother path linking needs (Services) with proof (Portfolio) and leading clearly to action (Contact/Quote).
